Genetic Sequences was a pretty confusing project for me at first. I saught help from Mr. Oswald during this project for much needed guidance. Overall this project helped me become a more proficient coder. I used variables, functions, conditionals, arrays, loops and objects. As you can see, this project included all of the "six things," and due to this, I was able to be introduced to the idea of them in a fun way. I used variables to define things to refer back to them later on. I used functions for many things in this project, one of them being replacing all the "T's" with "U's" in the rnaTranscription function to solve the rna problem. I also used conditonals a lot in this project, one of the uses being to press keys to switch from problem to problem. I used arrays and onjects to create letters to define the nucleotides in this project. Finally I used for loops to display the letters of the dna strand in one instance. This is seen when I for loop and array.
